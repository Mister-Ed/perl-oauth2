LWP-Authen-OAuth2

LWP::Authen::OAuth2 lets you access OAuth 2 protected APIs with LWP.
Specifically it provides helper methods to construct all requests to the
service provider, and takes care (if possible) of details like
automatically refreshing tokens when needed.

There can be wide variation between implementations of OAuth 2.  Simple
implementations can be handled with some configuration information.  But
hooks are available to handle more complex service providers.
