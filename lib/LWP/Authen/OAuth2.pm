LWP::Authen::OAuth2 - Make requests to OAuth2 APIs.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

our $VERSION = '0.01';


=head1 SYNOPSIS

OAuth2 is a protocol that let's a I<user> tell a I<service provider> that a
I<consumer> has permission to use the I<service provider>'s APIs to do things
that require access to the I<user>'s account.  For a full explanation of the
protocol, the terminology, and this module's role in the process, see
L<LWP::Authen::OAuth2::Overview>.

LWP::Authen::OAuth2 is a subclass of L<LWP::UserAgent> which simplifies your
life as a consumer by providing methods to make the initial permission
handshake, and then letting you send signed requests to the service
provider's API.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use LWP::Authen::OAuth2;

    my $foo = LWP::Authen::OAuth2->new();
    ...
